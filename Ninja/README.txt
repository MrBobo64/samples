
This is a cheesy game called Ninja in which you play as a little ninja fighting enemy ninjas.
The game is fairly generic except for the camera work.
The game normally tracks the movement of the player-controlled ninja, but when firing a fully charged
ninja star, the camera tracks the star until it goes offscreen.  Also, when performing a super-jump,
the camera zooms in on the ninja as he goes up and back out as he unleashes his devastation.  Finally,
when the final boss comes out, the camera moves and zooms so that the player and the final boss are always
on screen.

Here is the game in action:
