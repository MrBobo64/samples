
This is the bonus system of a larger game called PongOut.
The game features paddles on opposite sides of a screen controlled by two opponents who
attempt to destroy bricks in the center by bouncing a ball.
Destroyed bricks release bonuses to be collected by players.
The bonus system allowed for all bonuses to be treated in a uniform way, so once the system was in place,
adding individual bonuses took a matter of minutes.
The ones here have the effects of expanding the paddle, shrinking the paddle, freezing your opponent,
slowing down the ball, and speeding up the ball.
