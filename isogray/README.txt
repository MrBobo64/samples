
This program was to be part of a larger image editing program.
This program takes in a picture, a red-green-blue value, and a "radius".
The parts of the picture that have a color equal to the given value or within the "radius" are kept,
and all other parts of the picture turn to grayscale.

This is great for taking a picture of someone and turning it grayscale except for some item of clothing.
